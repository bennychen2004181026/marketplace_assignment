    # Because my app's searching features is runing base on the Categories and sub-category of all items, a handy method is
  # defined here to access all the category tree node with the help of ancestry gem method 'roots' and 'children'.

    # Arrange all the category dates in an array, while the self.roots returns an array of first class categories and the array inject method will 
    # produces accumulating funtion base on the categories array. The empty array argument is the initial value which the 'result' represents,
    # While the 'parent' presents every element in self.roots array which is first class category.
    # In the inject block, I declear a empty array to contain all the categories and then add all the sub categories array indisde the array and
    # after combine the initial empty row array it finally returns an array contains specific first class category in index 0 
    # and corresponing sub categories array as the second element in index 2. And the this array goes in the initial result empty array box, and
    # accumulate other array of category and its own sub categories.
    # The reslut will look like this: [[C1,[c11,c12,c13...]],[C2,[c21,c22,c23...]],[C3,[c31,c32,c33...]]...]
    # And the, I can invoke this handy method in what ever controllers action to get the main and sub categories record and loop through the result
    # and send the result back to view.
